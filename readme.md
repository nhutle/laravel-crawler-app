## Live demo

I have tried to deploy the project on AWS Elastic Beanstalk but can not access it via SSH from my Windows, so that you can not log-in for sure.

## Note

I took me 2 days to realize that PHP CodeIgniter fails to manage crob job efficiently, then Laravel came out. I spent 2 more days to learn Laravel and this app has been build in 3 days only.
