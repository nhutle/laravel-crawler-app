## Live demo

I have tried to deploy the project on AWS Elastic Beanstalk but can not access it via SSH from my Windows, hence you can not log-in for sure. I will need to fix it then, at least succeed to ssh to my EC2.

## Issues

- ~~No API implementation at the moment, but it's on my bucket list~~

- When click on `Open it` <- Google Page Cache, somehow its JavaScript redirects user to a new page.

- Live demo is broken.

- Basic implementation. It took me 2 days to realize that PHP CodeIgniter fails to manage crob job efficiently, then Laravel came out. I spent 2 more days to learn Laravel and this app has been build in 3 days only.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within this app, feel free to create issues and pull requests. I will take a look and fix them asap.
